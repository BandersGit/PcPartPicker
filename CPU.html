            The CPU, Central Processing Unit, or simply processor, 
            is the main chip in a computer responsible for carrying out all tasks. 
            Itâ€™s responsible for telling all the other components in a computer what to do, 
            according to the instructions it is given by the programs (software) running on that computer.

            What you should be looking for is the speed, most often written in Ghz, and the amount of cores,
            as one core is essentially it's own CPU
